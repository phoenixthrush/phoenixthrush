<samp>I have been passionate about coding since 2016, when a friend showed me a small Batch script with a Matrix-style effect. It was just a few lines of code that printed random numbers in green, but it sparked my interest in programming.</samp>

<samp>Since then, I have explored Linux, built my own PC, and experimented with a Raspberry Pi running open-source projects such as music servers and NAS setups. I also rented VPS servers to run Tor relays, which introduced me to server administration.</samp>

<samp>Most of my learning has come from online resources, particularly YouTube. Over time, I focused mainly on Python and web development, while also working with C and Rust for projects that require compiled languages.</samp>

<samp>I am generally interested in technical topics, with a stronger focus on cybersecurity. I make it a point to learn new skills regularly, currently exploring Rust and performing occasional reverse engineering using Ghidra.</samp>

<samp>I have experience with Gentoo and currently use Arch Linux. I enjoy trying out new technologies and prefer open-source software whenever possible. Several internships have given me insight into professional IT work and reinforced my practical skills.</samp>

<samp>I am currently studying Practical Computer Science in Germany, focusing on Java application development and systems technology. Outside of computing, I enjoy music and story-driven games such as NieR: Automata, Life is Strange, Tomb Raider, and Resident Evil, as well as games with choices and consequences like Detroit: Become Human.</samp>

<samp>Looking ahead, I am open to various paths in technology, whether software development or other IT-related fields, and I am eager to continue learning and contributing to meaningful projects.</samp>
