<samp>I have been interested in coding since 2016. It started when a friend showed me a small Batch script with a Matrix-style effect when I was in Year 6. It was only a few lines of code that printed random numbers in green, but it immediately caught my interest.</samp>

<samp>After that, I started learning Linux and how computers work in general. I built my own PC and later got a Raspberry Pi, which I used to experiment with open source projects like music servers and NAS setups. I also rented VPS servers to run Tor relays, which got me into server administration.</samp>

<samp>Most of what I learned came from online resources, especially YouTube. Over time, this led me mainly to Python and web development. Python is my main language now, but for projects that need to be compiled, I also use C and sometimes Rust.</samp>

<samp>I am interested in technical topics in general, with a stronger focus on cybersecurity. I try to learn new things regularly. At the moment, I am learning Rust and occasionally do some reverse engineering using Ghidra.</samp>

<samp>I used Gentoo in the past, but I now use Arch Linux. I like trying out new technologies and prefer open source software over proprietary alternatives. I have also done several internships, which gave me a better understanding of what day-to-day work in IT actually looks like.</samp>

<samp>I am currently studying Practical Computer Science in Germany, focusing on Java application development and systems technology. Outside of computing, I am also interested in music and games. I especially enjoy story driven games like NieR: Automata and Life is Strange, as well as older titles such as Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Games with choices and consequences, like Detroit: Become Human, also stand out to me.</samp>

<samp>When it comes to the future, I am not entirely sure what direction I will take. It could be software development, or something completely different outside of technology.</samp>
