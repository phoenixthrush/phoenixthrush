<samp>I've been interested in coding since 2016. It all started when a friend showed me some amazing Matrix-style code in Batch when I was in Year 6. It was just three lines of code that generated random numbers in bright green, and I was instantly hooked.</samp>

<samp>From there, I immersed myself in learning about Linux and how computers work, and I built my own PC. Then I got my hands on a Raspberry Pi and started exploring open-source projects, such as music and NAS servers. I also rented VPS servers to host Tor relays and became interested in server administration.</samp>

<samp>Thanks to YouTube, my coding journey mainly led me to Python and web development. Python has become my everyday language, but for projects that need to be compiled, I also use C and, when possible, Rust.</samp>

<samp>I'm passionate about all things technical, especially cybersecurity. I try to learn something new every now and then. Currently, I'm learning Rust, and occasionally I do some reverse engineering using Ghidra.</samp>

<samp>I used to use Gentoo, but I'm now an Arch user. I enjoy exploring new technologies and moving away from proprietary software. I have also gained valuable experience through multiple internships, which has given me an understanding of the day-to-day difficulties of working in IT.</samp>

<samp>I am currently studying Practical Computer Science, focusing on Java Application Development and Systems Technology, here in Germany. However, I also have a passion for music and games. I especially love story-driven games such as NieR:Automata and Life is Strange, as well as classic titles such as Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. I think games with choices and consequences, like Detroit: Become Human, are really awesome.</samp>

<samp>Regarding the future, I'm not quite sure what path I'm going to take. It could be software development, or maybe something completely different outside of technology.</samp>
